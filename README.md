# Network-Analysis-using-Graphs-Data-Structures
This project focuses on memory optimization using adjacency lists to represent graphs efficiently. Linked lists are utilized for building the graph structure, with a main class containing nodes indexed uniquely via strings. These linked lists are nested to create a network. The project revolves around authors, co-authors, and publications, where authors can have multiple publications and vice versa, forming a dense graph structure. Isolated vertices represent authors with only one publication. Subgraphs represent connections between publications contributed to by multiple authors. Algorithms such as Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, In and Out Algorithms for Strongly Connected Components, and Weakly Connected Components Algorithm are implemented to analyze the graph. Due to hardware limitations, datasets were reduced for easier processing on laptops.
